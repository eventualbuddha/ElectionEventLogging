# Voting - Election Event Logging CDF Specification

This repository holds the NIST Special Publication 1500-101 Election Event Logging common data format specification and related information and files that are being created by NIST and collaborators.  The specification is complete and awaiting final publishing by NIST.  Besides the PDF and Word versions of the specification located in this repository, there is an HTML version being developed at https://pages.nist.gov/ElectionEventLogging.

The election event logging specification is for election event logs produced by election devices used in U.S. states and territories.  The logs contain information generated by voting-related applications such as election management systems (EMS), electronic pollbooks, ballot marking devices, ballot scanners, or other vote-capture applications that are operating on the election devices.  The types of information logged include items required in the current and next versions of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) such as timestamps, event IDs, and event types, however manufacturers may include additional information in the logs.
The purpose of this specification is to provide a concise, interoperable XML format for manufacturers to integrate into their voting equipment and for election offices, researchers, testing laboratories and other groups to use in their own software.  The advantages of using this specification include:
 - Election logs are in the same, defined format regardless of device manufacturer.
 - Manufacturers can use the same, defined format for defining event codes and other information that may be specific to their own equipment.
 - Analyzing election logs produced by different types of equipment and different manufacturers is made significantly easier.
